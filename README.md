# Liteload
LiteLoad is a visual, drag-and-drop interface that helps warehouse teams plan, build, and optimize truck loads faster and with fewer mistakes. It replaces outdated paper lists and legacy AS/400-style systems with a simple layout. This idea came directly to me from working warehouse, where a hand-drawn prototype made the process more intuitive.
